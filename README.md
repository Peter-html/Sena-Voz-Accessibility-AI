# Sena Voz – Sign Language Gesture Communication 🤟🗣️

Sena Voz is an **AI-powered accessibility project** designed to bridge the communication gap for **blind and speech-impaired users** through **sign language gesture recognition**.  
The system converts hand gestures into **text and voice output**, enabling inclusive communication on digital platforms. It also includes a **learning module** to help users practice and master sign language.
